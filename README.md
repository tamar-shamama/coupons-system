# coupons-system
a project for John Bryce's Java full stack course

the final project of the course.

the user can sign in to the coupons system's website as an administrator (with hard-coded username and password), a company, or a customer.

as an administrator, you can create, delete and update companies and customers. you can view detailes and change passwords.

as a company, you can create coupons of different (so far hard coded) categories, and view how many of them are left.

as a customer, you can view the coupons of the different companies, and buy coupons.

the registration as company and customer is done by a JWT. the data about companies, customer and coupons is saved in a MySql database.
